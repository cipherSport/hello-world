INTRO TO GITHUB

tWIMC,

just about to complete my degree, I felt I had taken too long to decide which branch of study I wanted to focus. I loved programming, circuit building, understanding properties of materials ... I had enjoyed many of my courses and could not decide. Luckly, an old friend dropped by and showed me the way; I was introduced to DevOps. This is where my story begins.
